Virtual Machines.
Infrastructure as a Service.

By default, your EC2 machine comes with:
* A private IP for the internal AWS Network
* A public IP for the WWW

When you SSH into your EC2 machine:
* We can’t use a private IP, because we are not in the same network
* We can only use the public IP

If your machine is stopped and then restarted, the public IP will change

## EC2 User Data
* It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script
* Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
* That script is only run once at the instance first start
* Purpose: Ec2 data is used to automated boot tasks such as:
    * Installing updates
    * Installing software
    * Downloading common files from the internet
* The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user
  
## EC2 Meta Data
* Information about your EC2 instance
* It allows EC2 instances to "learn" about themselves without having to use an IAM role for that purpose
* Powerful but one of the least known features to developers
* You can retrieve IAM roles from the metadata but **not** IAM policies
* URL: {ec2-ip-address}/latest/meta-data

## EC2 Instance Launch Types 
- **On Demand Instances**: short workload, predictable pricing
- **Reserved Instances**: long workloads (>= 1 year)
- **Convertible Reserved Instances**: long workloads with flexible instances
- **Savings Plan**: commit to an amount of usage, long workloads
- **Spot Instances**: short workloads, for cheap, can lose instances
- **Dedicated Instances**: no other customers will share your hardware
- **Dedicated Hosts**: book an entire physical server, control instance placement
- **Capacity Reservation**: reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

#### On Demand Instance:
* Pay for what you use
* Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
* No long term commitment
* Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can’t predict how the application will behave
#### Reserved Instances
* Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
* Pay upfront, partially upfront or not upfront with relative discounts
* Reservation period can be 1 or 3 years
* Reserve a specific instance type 
* Can be Regional or Zonal
* Recommended for steady state usage applications (think database)
#### Convertible Reserved Instances
* Can change the EC2 instance type
* Up to 66% discount
#### Savings Plan
* Upto 72% discount
* Commit to a certain type of usage(eg - $10/hr for 3 years)
* Usage beyond the savings plan price is billed at the On-Demand price
* Locked to a specific instance family and region (eg- M5 in us-east-1)
* Flexible across-
    * instance size 
    * OS
    * Tenancy(Host, Dedicated, Default)
#### Spot Instances
* Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
* You bid a price and get the instance as long as it's under the price
* Price varies based on offer and demand
* Spot instances are reclaimed within a 2-minute notification warning when the spot price goes above your bid
* Used for batch jobs, Big Data analysis, or workloads that are resilient to failures
* Not great for critical jobs or databases
#### Dedicated Instances
* Instances running on hardware that’s dedicated to you
* May share hardware with other instances in same account
* No control over instance placement (can move hardware after stop / start)
#### Dedicated Hosts
* Physical dedicated Ec2 server for your use
* Full control of Ec2 Instance placement
* Visibility into the underlying sockets / physical cores of the hardware
* Allocated for your account for a 3-year period reservation
* More expensive
* Useful for software that have a complicated licensing model (Bring your own License)
* Or for a companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs
#### Capacity Reservation
* Reserve On-Demand instance capacity in an AZ for any duration
* No time commitment(create/ cancel anytime) no billing discounts
* Combine with regional reserved instances and savings plan for discounts
* Charged On-Demand rate whether you run an instance or not
* Suitable for shor-term uninterrupted workloads that need to be in a specific AZ

#### Which host is right for me?
- On demand: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the price for the time spent inside 
- Reserved: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount. 
- Savings Plans: pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any size room of the same type
- Spot instances: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms.You can get kicked out at any time 
- Dedicated Hosts: We book an entire building of the resort
- Capacity Reservation: You book a room for a period and pay full price even if you don't stay in it

## EC2 Pricing
- EC2 instances prices (per hour) varies based on these parameters:
  - Region you’re in
  - Instance Type you’re using
  - On-Demand vs Spot vs Reserved vs Dedicated Host
  - Linux vs Windows vs Private OS (RHEL, SLES, Windows SQL)
  - You are billed by the second, with a minimum of 60 seconds. 
  - You also pay for other factors such as storage, data transfer, fixed IP public addresses, load balancing
  - You do not pay for the instance if the instance is stopped. 

## AMIs (Amazon Machine Image)
### What's AMI?
- As we saw, AWS comes with base images such as:
  - Ubuntu
  - Fedora
  - RedHat
  - Windows
  - Etc...
- These images can be customized at runtime using EC2 User data
- But what if we could create our own image, ready to go?
- That’s an AMI – an image to use to create our instances
- AMIs can be built for Linux or Windows machines 

### Why you use a custom AMI?
- Using a custom-built AMI can provide the following advantages:
  - Pre-installed packages needed
  - Faster boot time (no need for long ec2 user data at boot time)
  - Machine comes configured with monitoring / enterprise software
  - Security concerns – control over the machines in the network
  - Control of maintenance and updates of AMIs over time
  - Active Directory Integration out of the box
  - Installing your app ahead of time (for faster deploys when auto-scaling)
  - Using someone else’s AMI that is optimized for running an app, DB, etc...
- **AMI are built for a specific AWS region (!)**

### Where can you get AMIs?
  - **Public AMIs**- provided by AWS
  - **Your Private AMI** - you build and maintain
  - **AWS MarketPlace AMI** - Sold by a 3rd party vendor
  - **Community AMI** - Built by the AWS community

## EC2 Instances Overview
- Instances have 5 distinct characteristics advertised on the website:
  - The RAM(type,amount,generation)
  - The CPU(type,make,frequency,generation,numberofcores)
  - The I/O (disk performance, EBS optimisations)
  - The Network (network bandwidth, network latency)
  - The Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) 

- AWS has the following naming conventions - 
    **m5.2xlarge**
    - m: instance class
    - 5: generation
    - 2xlarge: Size within the instance class

- ### Instance Types
    **1. General Purpose**: Balanced between compute, memory and networking. 
    - For diverse workloads such as code repos and web servers.
    - M and T class instances.
    - t2.micro - free tier 

    **2.Compute Optimized**: High performance processors.
    - C class instances.
    - Used for - Batch processing, Media transcoding, High performance web servers, High performance Computing(HPC), Scientific modeling and ML, Dedicate gaming servers.

    **3.Memory Optimised**: High RAM. For workloads that process large datasets in memory.
    - High performance relational/non-relational db, distributed web-scale cache stores, in-memory db optimized for BI(Bussiness Intelligence), Real time processing of unstructured data.
    - R. X and Z class.

    **4. Storage Optimized**: For tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
    - HIgh frequency online transaction process(OLTP), Relational and NoSql db, Cache for in-memory db(eg- Redis), Data warehousing, Distributed file systems.
    - I, D and H1 class.
