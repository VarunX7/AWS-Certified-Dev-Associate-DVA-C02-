# Aurora DB

* Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
* Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database)
* Aurora is “AWS cloud optimized” and claims 5x performance improvements over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
* Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 128 TB
* Aurora can have 15 replicas while MySQL has 5, and the replication process is faster (sub 10 ms replica lag)
* Failover in Aurora is instantaneous. It’s HA native.
* Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) - but is more efficient
- Aurora supports for cross region replication

#### High Availability and Read Scaling
* Creates 6 copies of your data across 3 AZs(Shared storage volume that can auto-expand upto 128TB)
    * 4 copies out 6 needed for writes
    * 3 copies out 6 for reads
    * if one replica's data gets corrupted it will 'self heal' using peer-to-peer replication 
    * Storage is stripped across 100s of volumes
* One Aurora instance takes writes(Master)
* Automated failover for Master in less than 30s
* Master + upto 15 read replicas serve reads (can setup auto-scaling for read replicas)

#### Aurora DB Cluster
- writer endpoint : pointing to the master
- reader endpoint: connection load balancing

#### Aurora Security
- Similar to RDS because uses the same engines
- **Encryption at rest** :
    - Master and replicas encryption using KMS - must be defined at launch time
    - If the master is not encrypted then the read replicas can't be encrypted
    - To encrypt an unencrypted DB, first take a snapshot, copy it and then restore as encrypted
    - Automated backups, snapshots and replicas are also encrypted
- **In-flight Encryption** : TLS-ready by default, use the AWS TLS root certificate client-side
- **IAM Authentication** : IAM roles to connect to DB (as well as traditional username and password)
- **Security Groups** : Control network access to RDS
- Audit Logs can be enabled and sent to CloudWatch Logs for longer retention

#### Aurora Serverless
- Automated database instantiation and auto-scaling based on actual usage
- Good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workloads
- No capacity planning needed
- Pay per second, can be more cost-effective 

#### Global Aurora
- Aurora Cross Region Read Replicas: 
	- Useful for disaster recovery
	- Simple to put in place
- Aurora Global Database (recommended):
	- 1 Primary Region (read / write)
	- Up to 5 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second
	- Up to 16 Read Replicas per secondary region
	- Helps for decreasing latency
	• Promoting another region (for disaster recovery) has an RTO of < 1 minute

#### Features Summarised
* Automatic failover
* Backup and recovery
* Isolaton and security
* Industry compliance
* Push button scaling
* Automated Patching with zero downtime
* Advanced monitoring
* Routine maintenance
* Backtracking: Restore data at any point of time without backups
